*Data Features* && *Justification*
-------------------------------------------------
Student Features:
    1. Previous Academic Performance (GPA/grades)
        Students with higher GPAs are likely to need less study time.

    2. Learning Speed (1-10)
        Faster learners need less time for each topic.

    3. Motivation Level (1-10)
        Highly motivated students spend more time engaging with challenging topics.

Learning Style:
    1. Retrieval Practice Count
        Frequent use of retrieval practice will reduce study time for topics, as it is an efficient learning technique.

    2. Elaboration Count
        Elaboration, being a deep processing technique, will generally increase study time.

    3. Concrete Examples Count
        Use of concrete examples will likely reduce study time, especially for complex topics, as they help clarify concepts.

    4. Interleaving Count
        Interleaving can lead to more study time as it requires frequent switching between related topics, which takes more time.

    5. Dual Coding Count
        Dual coding (visual + verbal) will also increase study time, as it involves engaging with both visual and verbal material.

Topic Features:
    1. Topic Difficulty (1-10)
        More difficult topics naturally require more time. So, the difficulty level will be positively correlated with the study time.
    
    2. Prerequisite Knowledge (1-10)
        Topics requiring a lot of prerequisite knowledge may require more time to review foundational material before tackling the topic itself.
    
    3. Bloom's Taxonomy Weakness Level
        If the student is weak in a topic, they will need more time to address gaps in understanding.

Behavioral Features:
    1. Conversation Duration (minutes)
        Longer conversation durations might indicate that the student is struggling with the topic, leading to more study time.
    
    2. Questions per Topic
        A higher number of questions correlates with more study time, as the student seeks clarification and deeper understanding.
