The identity matrix is like the \"1\" of matrix multiplication - it's the matrix that leaves everything unchanged.\n\n**Structure of Identity Matrix (I):**\n- All diagonal elements are 1\n- All off-diagonal elements are 0\n\nExamples:\n2×2: I = [1  0]    3×3: I = [1  0  0]\n          [0  1]              [0  1  0]\n                               [0  0  1]\n\n**Key Properties:**\n- A × I = I × A = A (multiplying by I doesn't change the matrix)\n- I represents the \"do nothing\" transformation\n- When A × A⁻¹ = I, we know A⁻¹ is the correct inverse\n\n**Geometric meaning:** The identity transformation leaves all points exactly where they are - no rotation, scaling, or movement!\n\nWould you like to verify this property with a quick multiplication example?",
