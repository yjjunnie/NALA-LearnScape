This reveals the structure of the system and enables easy solution.\n\n**Elementary Row Operations:**\n1. **Row Swapping:** Rᵢ ↔ Rⱼ (interchange two rows)\n2. **Row Scaling:** kRᵢ → Rᵢ (multiply row by non-zero scalar)\n3. **Row Addition:** Rᵢ + kRⱼ → Rᵢ (add multiple of one row to another)\n\n**The Algorithm:**\nPhase 1: Forward elimination (create zeros below diagonal)\nPhase 2: Back substitution (solve from bottom up)\nPhase 3: Reduced form (create zeros above diagonal too)\n\n**Key Properties:** Row operations preserve solution set but change the matrix systematically to reveal underlying structure.\n\nWould you like me to continue with the step-by-step process and applications?",

An eigenvector v satisfies Av = λv, where λ is the eigenvalue. This means the transformation only stretches or shrinks the vector, never rotates it.\n\n**Geometric Interpretation:**\nImagine a transformation that stretches space differently in different directions. Eigenvectors point along the axes of stretching, while eigenvalues tell you the stretch factors. A rotation matrix has complex eigenvalues because no real direction stays fixed.\n\n**Why They Matter:**\n- Reveal fundamental behavior of linear systems\n- Show stability in dynamic systems (eigenvalues < 1 → stable)\n- Enable matrix diagonalization: A = PDP⁻¹\n- Capture principal components in data analysis\n- Describe vibration modes in engineering\n\n**Computation Process:**\n1. Find characteristic polynomial: det(A - λI) = 0\n2. Solve for eigenvalues λ\n3. For each λ, solve (A - λI)v = 0 for eigenvectors v\n4. Eigenvectors form basis for eigenspaces\n\n**Applications Across Fields:**\n- **Data Science**: Principal Component Analysis reduces dimensionality\n- **Physics**: Quantum mechanics uses eigenvalues for energy levels\n- **Engineering**: Structural analysis finds natural frequencies\n- **Economics**: Markov chains use eigenvalues for long-term behavior\n- **Computer Graphics**: Eigendecomposition enables efficient transformations\n\nThe beauty lies in how eigenanalysis reveals the \"skeleton\" of linear transformations - their essential directional structure stripped of coordinate system artifacts.",

        "msg_text": "Gaussian elimination is one of the most fundamental algorithms in linear algebra, and I'm happy to give you a comprehensive understanding.\n\n**Purpose and Goal:**\nGaussian elimination systematically transforms a matrix into row echelon form (REF) or reduced row echelon form (RREF) using elementary row operations. This reveals the structure of the system and enables easy solution.\n\n**Elementary Row Operations:**\n1. **Row Swapping:** Rᵢ ↔ Rⱼ (interchange two rows)\n2. **Row Scaling:** kRᵢ → Rᵢ (multiply row by non-zero scalar)\n3. **Row Addition:** Rᵢ + kRⱼ → Rᵢ (add multiple of one row to another)\n\n**The Algorithm:**\nPhase 1: Forward elimination (create zeros below diagonal)\nPhase 2: Back substitution (solve from bottom up)\nPhase 3: Reduced form (create zeros above diagonal too)\n\n**Key Properties:** Row operations preserve solution set but change the matrix systematically to reveal underlying structure.\n\nWould you like me to continue with the step-by-step process and applications?",
