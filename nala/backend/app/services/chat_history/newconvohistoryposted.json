When you multiply a matrix by a vector, you're applying a transformation to that vector.\n\nFor example:\n- A scaling matrix like [2  0] will scale (stretch) objects by factor 2 in x-direction\n                        [0  2]\n- A rotation matrix like [cos θ  -sin θ] rotates objects by angle θ\n                         [sin θ   cos θ]\n\nSo if you have a point (3,4) and multiply it by the scaling matrix above, you get (6,8) - the point moved further from origin!
